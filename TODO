Multitasking
   Create guard page for ktask stacks
   Symmetric Multi Processing (SMP)
   Work on scheduler
   Create thread synchronization primitives
   Create message passing interface and shared memory for IPC
   Use locking and sti/cli to prevent race conditions
   Allow tasks to implicitly exit on return using exit_task
   Utilize page faults better (kill task that makes a page fault,etc)
   program execution
      create symbol table for dynamic linker
      elf file parser
   create systemcall interface
   use syscall/sysret instead of interrupt

drivers
   APIC, HPET, ATA PIO mode, PCI, network card
   basic ext2 filesystem, CMOS

dynamic memory
   Stress-test kmalloc
   kzmalloc, buddy allocator, slab allocator
 
initrd
   Add in cpio or tar support
   Add directory support to initrd and improve code

printing/screen manipulation:
  Double buffering
  Add escape sequences for vga colors in 3h mode
  Work on VGA 13h mode driver
     Implement basic shape drawing
     Later on, implement a frame buffer
  Get a dump of the vga font and create custom font 
  Add more vga register modes (get higher res dumps using qemu)
  use hwinfo --framebuffer to see and program video modes
    also use grub gfx directive to boot into a higher video mode
  make routines for 1024x768 graphics mode (set by multiboot header)
  make BGA driver

documentation/testing
   Add a how-to to explain how each subsystem works
      Add examples for each subsystem for reference
      and list the dependencies

misc tasks 
   use a cross compiler
   Create /dev virtual directory
   Get proper release/press code working with keyboard
   make as much as possible work through the VFS 
   port zeros to xen
   add in arch-specific bitwise operators, optimizations (AVX, SIMD, etc)
   port over a c library (newlib, uClib, musl)

advanced os examples:
   dragonfly bsd, minix, plan9, genode, haiku, helenos, redox

low-priority
   add random number generator, md5 sum function
   try to boot UEFI with grub-efi
   add cpuid functions
   use timer channel 2 to play sound on pc speaker
   work on arm arch code with qemu-arm
