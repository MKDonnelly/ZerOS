Heap allocater 
   Model the heap as a linked list.
   Initially, it will have one node
   full of free space. As allocations come
   in, it is split up and marked as allocated.
   Upon freeing, the chunk of memory looks to
   the last and next item to see if it can merge
   with any other free space.
   struct heapNode{
      udword nextAddr;
      uword size;
      ubyte attributes; 
   };
   Attributes can contain information such as 
   if the block is being used,
