printing/screen manipulation:
  Implement a frame buffer in 3h mode
  Add function to scroll.c to scroll both ways
  Implement a k_putchar_at and abstract
     k_print_at in vgacommon
  Scroll screen when text input reaches the end
      allow arrow keys to scroll through buffer 
  Work on VGA 13h mode driver
     Implement basic shape drawing
     Later on, implement a frame buffer
  Better utilize vga colors in 3h mode
      (see https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/Kaminou-Kernel/blob/master/kernel/includes/sys/video.h)
   Create better print output (BUG,LOG,etc)
      and catch errors by using __FILE__
      Use macros to create debug print info
  Get a dump of the vga font and create custom font 
  Add more vga modes
  Improve format capabilities of k_printf (print string)
 

utils:
   Create a basic file editor by dumping a file into the
      frame buffer and copying it back once done.
   List files in initrd
   Write a simple shell

misc:   
   Unit tests for various subsystems
   Abstract the heap so that multiple 
      heaps can coexist
   Add a how-to to explain how each subsystem works
      Add examples for each subsystem for reference
   Work on kmalloc
      Create a slab allocator (have fixed size block ready)
      Stress-test kmalloc
   Add alarms to timer subsystem
   Timer on screen is currently broken
      when going into the minutes range
   Work on multiboot header and understand
      what each field is doing
   Add directory support to initrd and improve
      initrd code
   Create /dev virtual directory
   Copy the initrd over to some space of memory
      so that it is not overwritten. Or at least
      page-protect it.
   create function to invalidate a page
      asm volatile ("invlpg (%0)" : : "b" (page_addr) : "memory")
   Add random number generator
   Add a getc function and add max length to getline
      use getline more
   Use structures to hold more information in devices
   Try to boot UEFI with grub-efi
   Add cpuid functions
   Learn qemu to better debug the kernel
   Impelement call gate
      Add GDT descriptor w/ CPL = 3 and type of
      trap gate to a function as the base and limit
      call using 
          jmp <GDT offset>:0x0
   Use timer channel 2 to play sound on pc speaker
   Implement APIC
   Implement HPET
   Implement multitasking
   Implement user mode
