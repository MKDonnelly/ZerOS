Directory structure
   -> boot
      Anything related to booting the system 
      is placed in the boot directory.
   -> cpu
      Anything related to how the cpu operates,
      such as interrupts and halting, goes here.
   -> drivers
      Anything related to controlling a piece of 
      hardware that is not the cpu goes here.
   -> kernel
      Anything related to the basic kernel 
      functionality, such as scheduling or memory
      management, goes here.
   -> lib
      Any useful routines that are not hardware
      specific or core kernel functions.
      
Notation:
   -> #define <something>_P = This is a port
   -> #define <something>_C = This is a command
   -> #define <something>_M = This is a bit mask
   Underscores preceeding data or function means that
   that should only be used within the file. Using a 
   function with this notation without knowing how
   it works is a bad idea.
